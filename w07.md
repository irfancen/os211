# Top 10 List of Week 07 {#title}
<br>

### 1. [Introduction of Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/)
This article tells us about the Synchronization in Operating Systems. This article somewhat summarizes the theories that are in the Operating Systems slide.

### 2. [What is a Race Condition?](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/race-conditions)
This article shows us about Race Condition in Operating Systems. The article explained about race condition very well and has an illustration to better explain it.

### 3. [Introduction to Deadlocks in Operating System](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/deadlocks)
This article tells us about Deadlocks in Operating Systems. The article includes a comparison with starvation and 
some methods to use to avoid deadlocks.

### 4. [Recovery from Deadlock in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recovery-from-deadlock-in-operating-system/)
This article tells us how to recover from a deadlock. One of the methods explained is to kill the process. It is rather obvious and easiest way to recover from a deadlock. Though it came with a price of calculations may need to be recalculated.

### 5. [Process Synchronization: Critical Section Problem in OS](https://www.guru99.com/process-synchronization.html)
This article shows us about the Critical Section Problem in Operating Systems. The article explains about critical sction problem by explaining about process syncronization first. The article also includes the solutions to the critical section problem.

### 6. [What is a Semaphore?](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/semaphore)
This article tells us about what Semaphore is. The article includes a pseudocode to better explain semaphore Wait and Signal operation. It also mentions on how to avoid Deadlocks and Starvations.

### 7. [Semaphore vs. Mutex](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/semaphore-vs-mutex)
This article shows us about the difference between Semaphore and Mutex. The article is equipped with images and a table to show us how Semaphore and Mutex differs.

### 8. [What is a Monitor in Computer Science?](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/monitor)
This article tells us about Monitors in Operating Systems (not the computer component). What's interesting here is that the article doesn't show us the implementation in C Programming Language, the implementation in the article is in Java.

### 9. [Guide to the Synchronized Keyword in Java](https://www.baeldung.com/java-synchronized)
This article shows us about Syncronized in Java. This topic caught my eyes because it reminds me of Singleton Pattern in Advanced Programming Course I currently take. The Singleton pattern have one main issue which is multithreading. The Syncronized keyword is one of the solution to avoid the issue.

### 10. [Guide to the Volatile Keyword in Java](https://www.baeldung.com/java-volatile)
This article tells us about Volatile in Java. This topic is also mentioned in the Advanced Programming Course along with Syncronized keyword mentioned above.
