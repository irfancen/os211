<br>

### 1. [CPU Scheduling in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)
This article tells us about CPU scheduling in Operating Systems. The article tells us why we need scheduling and the objectives on process scheduling. It also has some facts about scheduling algorithms.

### 2. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling/)
This article shows us about Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling. The article has a table to help the readers to better understand the difference between the two.

### 3. [CPU Scheduling Algorithms in Operating Systems](https://www.guru99.com/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.html)
This article tells us about CPU Scheduling Algorithms in Operating Systems. The article show several CPU Scheduling Algorithms in detail, each with their own characteristics. It also includes a summary for each algorithms.

### 4. [Priority Scheduling Algorithm](https://www.guru99.com/priority-scheduling-program.html)
This article shows us about Priority Scheduling Algorithm. The article  shows the types of priority scheduling, the characteristics, and the example with pictures for readers to better understand. 

### 5. [Scheduling Priorities - Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/scheduling-priorities)
This article tells us about Priority Scheduling in Windows Operating Systems. The article shows several priority classes and levels with their base priority in form of a table.

### 6. [When you set a 100% CPU program to real-time priority, you get what you asked for](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100610-00/?p=13753)
This article shows us about what will happen if you set a program with 100% CPU usage a real-time priority. The article is written by one of the developers in the Windows 95 team, Raymond Chen.

### 7. [Lottery Process Scheduling in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lottery-process-scheduling-in-operating-system/)
This article tells us about Lottery Process Scheduling in Operating Systems. This scheduling method caught my attention because the processes are scheduled randomly. 

### 8. [Completely fair Scheduler (CFS) and Brain Fuck Scheduler (BFS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/completely-fair-scheduler-cfs-and-brain-fuck-scheduler-bfs/)
This article shows us about Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) and Brain Fuck Scheduler (BFS). Both process scheduler are the ones currently used in Linux. The article explained about both scheduler very well and easy to understand.

### 9. [Multiple-Processor Scheduling in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-processor-scheduling-in-operating-system/)
This article tells us about Multiple-Processor Scheduling in Operating System. The article explained multiple-prcessor scheduling very well and in great detail, it is totally woth the read.
