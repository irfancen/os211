# Top 10 List of Week 02 {#title}
<br>

### 1. [Public Key and Private Keys](https://www.comodo.com/resources/small-business/digital-certificates2.php)
This article shows us what are public and private keys and how are they are related to each other. It also shows what they are used for, mainly to be used to create Digital Signatures.

### 2. [What is Social Engineering?](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-social-engineering)
This site tells us about what Social Engineering is. It also shows the types of methods used in Social Engineering, including the most common one, Phishing. What I personally think is most important in this site is how to spot and prevent Social Engineering attacks. 

### 3. [Everything You Need To Know About Kali Linux](https://www.edureka.co/blog/ethical-hacking-using-kali-linux/)
This article tells us about one of Linux Distributions that are most used by hackers (and ethical hackers). What's interesting here is that the Operating System is free to use, yet it has tons of penetration testing tools included. Probably why hackers use this Operating System in the first place.

### 4. [SHA-256 Algorithm](https://www.solarwindsmsp.com/blog/sha-256-encryption)
This article tells us about the widely used hash function, SHA-256. The article also tells us how secure SHA-256 is. What's interesting for me is that a brute-force attack has the worst case scenario of 2^256 attempts to decrypt the hashed data. That much possible hash values just makes it almost impossible for anyone to get the original data.

### 5. [Virtual Machine for Malware Analysis](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-machine-for-malware-analysis/)
This article shows us one of the use of Virtual Machines, which is Malware Analysis. This article will discuss some topics regarding setting up your virtual machine for malware analysis and how to protect your Host Machine from the malware. 

### 6. [Protection Ring - GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/protection-ring/)
GeeksForGeeks has posted a lot of Computer Science related content with easy to understand explanation and detailed information. This article shows us about Protection Rings, the mechanism to provide Computer Security.

### 7. [Negative Rings in Intel Architecture: The Security Threats That You've Probably Never Heard Of](https://medium.com/swlh/negative-rings-in-intel-architecture-the-security-threats-youve-probably-never-heard-of-d725a4b6f831)
This article tells us about Negative Rings on Intel Architecture. Though it might sound weird at first, but on Intel Architecture, there are actually more than the usual 4 levels of privilege. Though the Negative Rings mention in this article is not actual processor protection rings but more as conceptual levels of privilege.

### 8. [What Is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?](https://authy.com/what-is-2fa/)
This article tells us about Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), an extra level of authentication that are quite popular now. It also tells us about why passwords are bad but still better than no protection at all. It is the very reason why 2FA exists in the first place and with various forms, including hardware and software tokens.

### 9. [How Attackers Bypass Modern Two-factor Authentication and How to Protect Your Users](https://www.onespan.com/blog/how-attackers-bypass-modern-two-factor-authentication-and-how-protect-your-users)
This article shows us how Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) are able to be bypassed by hackers. In the article, one of the method used to bypass 2FA is by phishing. It also shows us how to protect againts the attack by using a method called dynamic linking.

### 10. [What is Biometric Authentication? Use Cases, Pros & Cons](https://www.onespan.com/topics/biometric-authentication)
This article tells us about Biometric Authentication and how it is far more superior than passwords. This article also tells us the types of Biometric Authentication available, each with their pros and cons. There are some extra content in the end including the uses of Biometric authentication and the myths of about Biometrics getting busted.
