<br>

### 1. [Difference among Bit, Byte and Words](https://www.businessmanagementideas.com/information-technology/computers/difference-among-bit-byte-and-words-computer/10225)
This article shows us about the difference between bits, bytes, and words. To sum it up, bits are basically the smallest unit that has a value of either 1 or 0 with bytes are the collection of bits and words are the collection of bytes.

### 2. [Qubits  the building blocks of the quantum computer](https://www.unibas.ch/en/News-Events/Uni-Nova/Uni-Nova-130/Uni-Nova-130-Qubits-the-building-blocks-of-the-quantum-computer.html)
This article tells us about Qubits, the smallest unit of a Quantum Computer. The difference being that a qubit are able to be in a superposition of both 1 and 0 simultaneously.

### 3. [Logical and Physical Address in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/)
This article shows us about Logical and Physical address in Operating Systems and how are they different. GeeksForGeeks gives a table to show the difference between the two based on address space, visibility, etc. 

### 4. [Linux Basics: Static Libraries vs. Dynamic Libraries](https://medium.com/swlh/linux-basics-static-libraries-vs-dynamic-libraries-a7bcf8157779)
This article tells us about the difference between Static and Dynamic Libraries. This medium article has a visual representation of how they differ. It also includes a couple of videos to learn further about Static and Dynamic Libraries.

### 5. [Difference between Internal Fragmentation and External Fragmentation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-internal-fragmentation-and-external-fragmentation)
Fragmentation is a condition where processes cannot be allocated into memory blocks because of the small size which causes those memory blocks unused. This article shows us the difference between Internal and External Fragmentation. It also includes a table to show us the differences easier.

### 6. [What is Memory Allocation in Operating System?](https://binaryterms.com/static-and-dynamic-memory-allocation.html)
This article tells us about Memory Allocation in Operating Systems. The article gives us detailed information including the types of memory allocation with the advantages and disadvantages of each type.

### 7. [Memory Leakage as Fast As Possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67m5jwoNkfo)
This video tells us about what Memory Leak really is. What's great about this video is that the explanation is very easy to understand and filled with jokes to keep us, viewers, entertained.

### 8. [How does a software like Cheat Engine work?](https://superuser.com/questions/549041/how-does-a-software-like-cheat-engine-work)
Cheat Engine is a tool to modify the memory of running processes. This forum talks about how softwares like Cheat Engine work.

### 9. [What is Memory Swapping?](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/hardware/what-is-memory-swapping/)
This article tells us about Memory Swapping, the technology to provide more memory than is available in physical RAM. The article also gives us the advantages and limitations of memory swapping to know whether we have to use it or not.

### 10. [Swapper for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.allakore.swapper)
Mobile devices may not have swap memory, primarily because of space constraints. This application allows you to create a swap memory by using your internal memory or external memory. Although it may be slow, it helps a lot when you don't have that much RAM. Do keep in mind that this application requires root access to operate.
